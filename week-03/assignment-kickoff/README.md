"Welcome to my reflection about my week 03 assignment, where I've created a landing page for the BLAHBLAHBLAH brand

## Explanation of the brand

The brand is BLAH.

## What the Brand Guidelines are

The brand guidelines include:

- Primary colour: something
- Secondary colour: something else
- Typography: nice things
- Imagery: nice people

## Customer Persona

### Definition

I created one customer persona to apply to my app. Here's "Alex the Freelancer" and some of the elements about him:

- Name - Alex the Freelancer

- Gender - Male

- Age - 30

- Location - UK, London based for work.

- Education - University educated. In marketing, which helps him with his freelance projects.

- Profession - Freelancer. Works by himself usually, offering creative services such as graphic design, content creation.

### Application to the app

- We should take a mobile-first approach to design on our website. It should be friendly towards ‘on the go usage’. this will be reflected in the layout of the features and buttons, and general design.

- Simple, user-centric dashboard and navigation for easy expense tracking (this is more of an in-app feature, but the simple design and navigation should reflect in our website)
