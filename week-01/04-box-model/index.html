    <div class="box">hello! I'm a box who is 180x180</div>

    <p>
      The box above is larger than the 140x140px we defined in the CSS, because
      the border and padding add to it.
    </p>

    <div class="box box-sized my-second-box some-other-class">
      hi, I'm 140x140
    </div>
    <p>
      This box however, has the 'box-sizing: border-box' rule applied to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means the size we give it will INCLUDE the padding and border, when
      calculated
    </p>
