    <h1>Image, Audio and Video Elements in HTML. Woop!</h1>

    <h2>Starting with Images</h2>
    <p>We can use the img tag to display static images</p>
    <p>
      It's important that we use a src, alt and perhaps sometimes width and
      height (although we can also do this in CSS)
    </p>
    <p>We can use image sources where the image url is copied from the web</p>
    <img
      src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/02/multimedia/29ROLLERCOASTER-02-lwgc/29ROLLERCOASTER-02-lwgc-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg"
      alt="An image of a rollercoaster where people are losing their hair"
      width="300"
    />
    <p>
      However, we want control over our media. So we should locally store and
      host our images
    </p>

    <img
      src="./assets/rollercoaster-tycoon.webp"
      alt="a nostalgic image of a classic game, rollercoaster tycoon"
      width="300"
    />

    <p>We can also use the img tag to display gifs</p>
    <img
      src="https://i.giphy.com/SFoBJLKAL7muMZlM12.webp"
      alt="a rollercoaster tycoon gif"
      width="300"
    />

    <h2>Audio</h2>
    <p>We use the audio tag to bring audio to our page</p>
    <p>
      We have to use the 'controls' attribute so that the player becomes visible
    </p>
    <audio src="./assets/sound-effect.mp3" controls loop></audio>
    <p>
      We can use the 'autoplay' attribute, however, this isn't good user
      experience, and generally is disabled by default
    </p>

    <h2>Video</h2>
    <p>We get videos to appear on our page with the ______ tag</p>
    <!-- We can't use an img tag for videos, because it doesn't know how to handle it! -->
    <!-- <img
      src="http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4"
      alt=""
    /> -->
    <video
      src="http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4"
      controls
      width="400"
      muted
      poster="./assets/bbb.png"
      autoplay
    ></video>
    <p>
      For videos, we should have the 'controls' attribute so that the user can
      control the video.
    </p>
    <p>We can also give it a width, or we can style the size in CSS</p>
    <p>
      The 'poster' attribute lets us place a template image onto the video
      before it plays. Again, better user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      And we can also use 'autoplay' and 'muted' to further direct our video.
    </p>

    <h2>BONUS ROUND! iframes!</h2>
    <p>This is code copied from YouTube allowing us to embed a video</p>

    <iframe
      width="560"
      height="315"
      src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KOx0NdGJ7pc?si=GV8_ucmyndQQGLn3"
      title="YouTube video player"
      frameborder="0"
      allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
      referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
      allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
