# Build an API server

## Step 1: Create a package.json file

- We need to create this first to keep track of our installed dependencies (packages)

- Add "type": "module" to your package.json.

## Step 2: Install the Express package

- We are going to build our Express server with this package.

## Step 3: Build the Express server in a server.js file

## Step 4: Create a .gitignore file

- Write "node_modules" in there
